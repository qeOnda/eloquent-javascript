/*
Write a class called Group (since Set is already taken). 
Like Set, it has add, delete, and has methods. 
Its constructor creates an empty group, 
add adds a value to the group (but only if it isnâ€™t already a member), 
delete removes its argument from the group (if it was a member), 
and has returns a Boolean value indicating whether its argument is a member of the group. 
*/
